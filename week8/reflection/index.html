                        <li>Having learned another piece of the web development puzzle, things should be starting to come together now. What was different about functional programming from just HTML & CSS? Talk specifically about some new challenges you faced and how you overcame them individually or with the help of your classmates/instructor.</li>
                        <li>The workload has also increased substantially from the intro courses. How have you learned to cope with this (i.e. strategies that worked, or didn’t)? How can you improve on these as we enter harder and harder material?</li>
                        <li>What was your favorite part of this course? It can even be as simple as your favorite function. How can you see it being used in the real world (e.g. your future web development job or creating a full web application yourself)?</li>

                        <p>Functional programming (Javascript) allows for client side user interaction with a web page and also improves a users's experience. In this course, I felt a bit challenged at first with the new ES6 concepts and some of the array methods. Re-reading the material and with the help of the Learn-It's was a big help to overcome the challenges. Eventually the concepts made a lot of sense. In the end, I became even more comfortable using them as best practice!</p>

                        <p>My strategy with this course was to utilize the Scrimba videos and documentaton to throughly understand the course material and topics before doing the excercises and projects. I would spend several evenings re-reading the material and practicing with the Scrimba videos until I became completely comfortable with what was being taught. I think this is the most important thing moving forward with more difficult material. Understanding the concept is key.</p>

                        <p>My favorite part of this course was Objects, Classes and the concept of Prototypes. I find all of these concepts to be very powerful in a real world environment to make code cleaner, easier to maintain and more functional.</p>
